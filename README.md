# Cake Clash

This a game made with Godot, that I abandoned, because I didn't receive any feedback when publishing the demo. I published the source code on GitHub in case someone wants to continue working on this game and finish it.

The game is a local multiplayer game about cakes. You have to push your opponent out of the arena in order to win.

You can see my devlogs on itch.io [here](https://itch.io/t/2785923/cake-clash-a-local-multiplayer-game-about-cakes). The demo is in the releases.
